# Diminishing returns and Diminishing points

In economics, diminishing returns means the decrease in marginal (incremental) output of a production process as the amount of a single factor of production is incrementally increased, holding all other factors of production equal (ceteris paribus).

- This is a time-limited assignment of Diminishing Point data analysis and algorithm implementation.
